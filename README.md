# assistant
I wrote this console program as my first program ever.
Really hope You'll like it.
It's a simple program which can run some base commands
(like installing other programs)via terminal/console

To install it just drag the file "/home/assistant/assistant_OS/assistant"
to your "/bin" folder as a root.
!!!Remeber to choose the right OS version because it'll work but not as 
it should!!!
!!!On Debian it'll probably get an error. All what You need to do is drag
to the folder from error as a root!!!
The best way to use it is to add a new line "sudo assistant" to .bashrc or .zshrc file
to run it from autostart everytime you open terminal.                         
######################################################                    
To use it propely !!!important!!! run it everytime as a root.
To navigate use 1/2/3/4 numbers and write the name of package which 
interests You. I hope it'll get more functionality soon.
