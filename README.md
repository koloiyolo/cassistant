# cassistant
cassistant is a simple console helper which can be very helpfull
for new-to-linux users. It can run some basic commands
(like installing other programs) via terminal/console
It's my first program ever so I hope You'll enjoy it.
################################################################                     
To install it just drag the file "/home/cassistant/cassistant_OS/cassistant"
to your "/bin" folder as a root.
!!!Remeber to choose the right OS version because it'll work but not as 
it should!!!
!!!On Debian it'll probably get an error. All what You need to do is drag
to the folder from error as a root!!!
The best way to use it is to add a new line "sudo cassistant" to .bashrc or .zshrc file
to run it from autostart everytime you open terminal.                         
################################################################                    
To use it propely !!!important!!! run it everytime as a root.
To navigate use 1/2/3/4 numbers and write the name of package which 
interests You. I hope it'll get more functionality soon.
